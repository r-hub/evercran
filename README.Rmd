## The evercran CRAN snapshots

The evercran project has daily CRAN snapshots, starting from the very
beginning up to today. The URLs are of the form
```
http://evercran.r-pkg.org/YYYY/MM/DD
https://evercran.r-pkg.org/YYYY/MM/DD
```
and they start at 1999/01/01.

Package downloads are redirected to CRAN, so you will need an R download
method that follows redirection.

All the evercran containers (from R 0.65.1) in this repository are already
set up to an appropriate evercran snapshot: they use the date of the
*next* R release. (Except for the container of the latest R release, of
course, that uses a regular CRAN mirror instead of a snapshot.)

To use an evercran snapshot on a different R installation,
this should work on all R versions, as of today:
```
options(CRAN = "http://evercran.r-pkg.org/2010/10/10")
options(repos = c(CRAN = "http://evercran.r-pkg.org/2010/10/10"))
options(download.file.method = "wget")
```
Modify the URLs to use the snapshot date you'd like.
Add this to the `~/.Rprofile` file.
You'll also need to install the `wget` Debian package for the downloads to
work.
You can use a https URL if your `wget` installation supports https.

## R 0.0 (alpha-test) -- R 2.5.1

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/r-hub/evercran/<version>
docker run -ti ghcr.io/r-hub/evercran/<version>
```

These containers use Debian 3.1 (Sarge). Notes:

* All containers use the `linux/i386` architecture.
* While `wget` and `curl` have HTTPS support, in practice HTTPS
  does not work because of certificate errors.
* You can use the HTTP (not HTTPS!) PPA at https://ppa.r-pkg.org/evercran/
  to install more R versions:
  ```sh
  echo 'deb http://ppa.r-pkg.org/evercran sarge main' \
    >> /etc/apt/sources.list
  apt-get update -y
  apt-get install -y r-1.0.0
  ```
* The Debian R packages are also available as GitHub Releases, in the
  https://github.com/r-hub/R repository, e.g.:
  https://github.com/r-hub/R/releases/tag/v1.0.0
  (But you cannot directly download these from the containers, because
  of the broken HTTPS. Use the PPA to download them.)
* If you run this image on `x86_64` machines, then `arch`, `uname -a` and
  potentially similar commands report the architecture incorrectly as
  `x86_64`. Use the `linux32` entrypoint to work around this. We don't do
  this by default currently, because it causes issues on arm64 hosts
  (see https://github.com/r-hub/evercran/issues/3). E.g.:
  ```
  ❯ docker run -ti ghcr.io/r-hub/evercran/0.49:latest arch
  x86_64

  ❯ docker run -ti --entrypoint linux32 ghcr.io/r-hub/evercran/0.49:latest arch
  i686
  ```

## R 2.6.0 -- R 2.8.1

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/r-hub/evercran/<version>
docker run -ti ghcr.io/r-hub/evercran/<version>
```

These containers use Debian 4.0 (Etch). Notes:

* All containers use the `linux/i386` architecture.
* While `wget` and `curl` have HTTPS support, in practice HTTPS
  does not work well, because they use TLS v1, which is not supported by many
  servers.
* You can use the HTTP (not HTTPS!) PPA at https://ppa.r-pkg.org/evercran/
  to install more R versions:
  ```sh
  echo 'deb http://ppa.r-pkg.org/evercran etch main' \
    >> /etc/apt/sources.list
  curl -L http://ppa.r-pkg.org/rhub.gpg.key | apt-key add -
  apt-get update -y
  apt-get install -y r-2.6.0
  ```
* The Debian R packages are also available as GitHub Releases, in the
  https://github.com/r-hub/R repository, e.g.:
  https://github.com/r-hub/R/releases/tag/v2.6.0
  (But you cannot directly download these from the containers, because
  of the broken HTTPS. Use the PPA to download them.)
* The entry point of the containers is `linux32` to make sure that all
  programs know that they are running on `i386`. Call `linux32` manually
  if you change the entry point.

## R 2.9.0 -- R 2.12.2

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/r-hub/evercran/<version>
docker run -ti ghcr.io/r-hub/evercran/<version>
```

These containers use Debian 5.0.10 (Lenny). Notes:

* All containers use the `linux/i386` architecture.
* While `wget` and `curl` have HTTPS support, in practice HTTPS
  does not work well, because they use TLS v1, which is not supported by many
  servers.
* You can use the HTTP (not HTTPS!) PPA at https://ppa.r-pkg.org/evercran/
  to install more R versions:
  ```sh
  echo 'deb http://ppa.r-pkg.org/evercran lenny main' \
    >> /etc/apt/sources.list
  curl -L http://ppa.r-pkg.org/rhub.gpg.key | apt-key add -
  apt-get update -y
  apt-get install -y r-2.9.0
  ```
* The Debian R packages are also available as GitHub Releases, in the
  https://github.com/r-hub/R repository, e.g.:
  https://github.com/r-hub/R/releases/tag/v2.9.0
  (But you cannot directly download these from the containers, because
  of the broken HTTPS. Use the PPA to download them.)
* The entry point of the containers is `linux32` to make sure that all
  programs know that they are running on `i386`. Call `linux32` manually
  if you change the entry point.

## R 2.13.0 -- R 2.15.3

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/r-hub/evercran/<version>
docker run -ti ghcr.io/r-hub/evercran/<version>
```

These containers use Debian 6.0.10 (Squeeze). Notes:

* All containers use the `linux/i386` architecture.
* While `wget` and `curl` have HTTPS support, in practice HTTPS
  does not work well, because they use TLS v1, which is not supported by many
  servers.
* You can use the HTTP (not HTTPS!) PPA at https://ppa.r-pkg.org/evercran/
  to install more R versions:
  ```sh
  echo 'deb http://ppa.r-pkg.org/evercran squeeze main' \
    >> /etc/apt/sources.list
  curl -L http://ppa.r-pkg.org/rhub.gpg.key | apt-key add -
  apt-get update -y
  apt-get install -y r-2.13.0
  ```
* The Debian R packages are also available as GitHub Releases, in the
  https://github.com/r-hub/R repository, e.g.:
  https://github.com/r-hub/R/releases/tag/v2.13.0
  (But you cannot directly download these from the containers, because
  of the broken HTTPS. Use the PPA to download them.)
* The entry point of the containers is `linux32` to make sure that all
  programs know that they are running on `i386`. Call `linux32` manually
  if you change the entry point.

## R 3.0.0 -- R 4.3.1

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/r-hub/evercran/<version>
docker run -ti ghcr.io/r-hub/evercran/<version>
```

These containers use Debian 12.1 (Bookworm). Notes:

* All containers are available with `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`
  architectures.
* The amd64 Debian packages are available from
  https://github.com/rstudio/r-builds.
* The arm64 DEbian packages are available from the GitHub Releases at the
  https://github.com/r-hub/R repository E.g.
  https://github.com/r-hub/R/releases/tag/v4.3.1.
* To install additional R versions (or to install in a plain
  `debian:12` container, download it with `wget` or `curl`, ant install it
  with `apt install ./<filename>`. E.g.:
  ```sh
  apt-get update
  apt-get install -y curl
  curl -LO https://github.com/r-hub/R/releases/download/v4.3.1/r-rstudio-debian-12-4.3.1_1_arm64.deb
  apt install -y ./r-rstudio-debian-12-4.3.1_1_arm64.deb
  /opt/R/4.3.1/bin/R
  ```




## Containers with multiple R versions

For convenience we have containers that include many R versions installed.

All R versions are installed in `/opt/R/<version>`, so you can run one with
```
/opt/R/<version>/bin/R
```
For example to run R 0.65.1:
```
/opt/R/0.65.1/bin/R
```

| R versions                             | Container                    | OS                      |
|:---------------------------------------|:-----------------------------|:------------------------|
| R 0.0 (alpha-test) -- R 0.16.1 (alpha) | `ghcr.io/r-hub/evercran/pre` | Debian Sarge 3.1 i386   |
| R 0.49  -- R 1.0.0                     | `ghcr.io/r-hub/evercran/0.x` | Debian Sarge 3.1 i386   |
| R 1.0.0 -- R 1.9.1                     | `ghcr.io/r-hub/evercran/1.x` | Debian Sarge 3.1 i386   |
| R 2.0.0 -- R 2.15.3                    | `ghcr.io/r-hub/evercran/2.x` | Debian Wheezy 7.11 i386 |
